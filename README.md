This project is a Crypto Tracker application built with React.js and the CoinGecko API. It's a single-page application utilizing React Router for navigation across four main sections: Home, Dashboard, Compare, and Watchlist.

Dashboard: Displays a list of all cryptocurrencies with essential data such as current price and 24-hour price change. The UI dynamically adapts based on the price changes. Users can select different price types and view price history over a user-defined number of days, visualized through Chart.js.

Compare: Allows users to compare two selected cryptocurrencies by displaying their price trends on a graph over a chosen time period.

Watchlist: Helps users keep track of their favorite cryptocurrencies.

Material UI components are integrated into the project to enhance the overall user interface.
